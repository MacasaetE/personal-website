            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>I love to travel. I've recently been to Utah, Ireland, and the Netherlands. My favorite part was swimming in the Atlantic Ocean along the cliffs of Ireland. I want to go to Spain or Italy next, but I'm open to suggestions. </p>

            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <p>I've always loved to read. My favorite genres are Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Horror. See the Reading tab for my reading list.</p>

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>When I'm not in school I like to play video games. My favories are Stardew Valley and Elden Ring. </p>
